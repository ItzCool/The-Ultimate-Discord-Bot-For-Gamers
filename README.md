# Ultimate-Discord-Bot-for-Gamers
This is a WIP discord bot that will hopefully include everything that a discord bot for gamers needs, from stats in popular games like Apex and Fortnite, to helping you create a discord server from scratch! AGIAN THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND I AM NOT VERY SKILLED AT CODING IN ANY LANGUAGE!

# Description
This is a 'basic' discord bot written in Discord.js and Discord.js-commando
I have sources to the code I have used

# IMPORTANT
This is still a work in progress, if there are any issues or requests post them in the issues tab. Thanks
# REQUIREMENTS
You will need to create a role named "duos" for lfg to work currently. lfg command is still WIP

You will need a channel named "logs" and a channel named "reports" for the kick, ban, and report commands to function properly.

# NOTE:
"|" means "or"
"pfx" stands for the prefix that activates your commands. Currently the prefix is "gb!"

# Commands:
ft <stats platform username> or <shop> 
ping
rps 
help <command_name>
lfg <duos>
ban <id | mention> <reason>
clear <amount>
